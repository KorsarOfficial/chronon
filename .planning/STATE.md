# State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-26)

**Core value:** f(state, time, events) -> state' deterministic, fast, snapshotable, reversible
**Current focus:** v2.0 — time-travel + product platform

## Current Position

Phase: 13
Plan: 05 (next)
Status: 13-01+13-02+13-03+13-04 complete; TT-01..TT-08 done; tt_t lifecycle + bsearch rewind + step_back + diff shipped
Last activity: 2026-04-26 — p13.04 TT-06/07/08 tt_t lifecycle + bsearch rewind + step_back + diff <100ms@1M

## Performance Metrics

v1.0 shipped: 12 phases, 62 tests, ~30M IPS hybrid native JIT.
p13.01: 3 tasks, 4 files created, 12 modified, 5->6 tests, 65 min.
p13.02: 2 tasks, 1 file created, 3 modified, 6->8 tests, 30 min.
p13.03: 2 tasks, 1 file created, 6 modified, 8->8 tests (snapshot tests already counted), 45 min.
p13.04: 2 tasks, 1 file created, 3 modified, 8->9 tests, 35 min.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- p1..p12 all decisions logged in MILESTONES.md
- p12 native JIT pattern: rdi=cpu, [rdi+R_OFF+i*4] = r[i]; supports MOV/ADD/SUB/AND/OR/EOR + imm; fallback to interp on miss
- determinism kernel needed before snapshot (must remove implicit time/rand)
- WASM port deferred to p15 — needs WSA-free network stack first
- p13.01: tt_record_irq/uart_rx use strong no-ops (MinGW static-lib weak symbol gap); 13-04 replaces bodies
- p13.01: run_steps_full_g(jit_t*) is the TT determinism path; run_steps_full_gdb(gdb_t*) keeps gdb integration
- p13.01: jit_t is ~2MB; must not be stack-allocated (Windows 1MB default stack)
- p13.02: snap_blob_t includes uart_state (rx_q/replay_mode); eth.bus zeroed on save, refilled on restore
- p13.03: run_until_cycle in run.c (co-located with run_steps_full_g), declared in tt.h; run.h uses struct forward decls
- p13.03: snap_blob_t ~263KB; must be static in tests, same as jit_t ~2MB
- p13.04: tt_record_irq/uart_rx bodies replaced in-place (no weak override); targets in TT-06 test must be >= first snap cycle (stride boundary)
- p13.04: tt_diff uses FILE* -> stdio.h added to tt.h; snap_entry_t defined in tt.h alongside full tt_t struct
- p13.04: rewind mean latency 0.3ms at 1M history; bsearch 7 cmps + 0.14ms memcpy + worst-case 10K cycles forward replay

### Pending Todos

- direct block chaining (jmp rel32 inter-TB)
- LDR/STR native via helper-call
- flag-setter ops via LEA tricks
- WASM-compatible socket layer (postMessage)

### Blockers

none.
